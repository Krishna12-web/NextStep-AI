**Step 3: Commit and Push to GitHub**

1.  Open the GitHub Desktop app.
2.  You will see the new `globals.css` file.
3.  Write a summary like `Add global styles`.
4.  Click **"Commit to main"** and then **"Push origin"**.

After you have done this, go back to Netlify and redeploy. This will solve the final build error, and your project will be successfully deployed.
